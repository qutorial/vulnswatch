Feature: Showing Vulnerabilities
  As a vulnerabilty manager
  I want to see vulnerabilities, relevant vulnerabilities,
  sort them and filter them.

Scenario: All vulnerabilities can be seen
  When I go to vulnerabilities page
  Then I should see vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-1, CVE-2017-2, CVE-2017-2, CVE-2017-3, CVE-2017-4, 
  And I should see vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-5, CVE-2017-6, CVE-2017-7, CVE-2017-8, CVE-2017-9
  And I should see vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-10

Scenario: Relevant vulnerabilities are displayed right
  When I go to relevant vulnerabilities page
  Then I should see vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-1, CVE-2017-2, CVE-2017-4, CVE-2017-5, CVE-2017-6, 
  And I should see vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-7, CVE-2017-8, CVE-2017-9
  And I should not see vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-3, CVE-2017-10

Scenario: Search works, and it searches tags or summary despite tags
  When I go to vulnerabilities page
  And I search for OpenBSD
  Then I should see vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-1, CVE-2017-4, CVE-2017-8
  And I should not see vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-2, CVE-2017-3, CVE-2017-5, CVE-2017-6
  And I should not see vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-7, CVE-2017-9, CVE-2017-10
  When I search for Python
  Then I should see vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-5, CVE-2017-7
  And I should see vulnerability CVE-2017-10
  And I should see vulnerability CVE-2017-9

Scenario: Search works in combination with relevance
  When I go to relevant vulnerabilities page
  And I search for Python
  Then I should see vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-5, CVE-2017-7, CVE-2017-9
  But I should not see vulnerability: CVE-2017-10
  And I should not see vulnerability: CVE-2017-8

Scenario: Filtering works, part one
  When I go to vulnerabilities page
  And I filter name to be CVE-2017-1
  Then I should see vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-1, CVE-2017-10
  And I should not see vulnerability CVE-2017-2
  When I filter component to be libpy
  Then I should see vulnerability CVE-2017-10
  And I should not see vulnerability CVE-2017-1

Scenario: Filtering works, part two
  When I go to vulnerabilities page
  And I filter summary to be OpenBSD
  Then I should see vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-1, CVE-2017-4, CVE-2017-8
  When I filter component to be OpenBSD
  Then I should not see vulnerability CVE-2017-1

Scenario: Sorting on name works on vulnerabilities
  When I go to vulnerabilities page
  When I sort descending on name
  Then I should see vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-2, CVE-2017-1
  And vulnerability CVE-2017-2 should stand before CVE-2017-1
  When I sort ascending on name
  Then I should see vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-2, CVE-2017-1
  And vulnerability CVE-2017-1 should stand before CVE-2017-2

Scenario: Sorting on name works on vulnerabilities
  When I go to relevant vulnerabilities page
  And I sort descending on name
  Then vulnerability CVE-2017-2 should stand before CVE-2017-1
  When I sort ascending on name
  Then vulnerability CVE-2017-1 should stand before CVE-2017-2
